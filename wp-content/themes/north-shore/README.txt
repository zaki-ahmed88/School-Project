== Description ==

North Shore is a redesigned look with an ocean feel for our multipurpose theme CityLogic. North Shore's modest but eye-catching design makes it a great choice for creating any website from travel to business to food, decor, lifestyle, sport and more. The ability to have a transparent header allows the use of bold homepage imagery by displaying either a static header image or slider - with the choice of using the built-in slider or any 3rd party slider plugin of your choice. North Shore integrates seamlessly with a number of popular FREE plugins such as WooCommerce, Contact Form 7 and Recent Posts Widget Extended. It also works great with SiteOrigin's Page Builder plugin making it quick and easy to create professional looking pages without any coding knowledge. You're always one step ahead with North Shore!
